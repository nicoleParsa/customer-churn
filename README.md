# customer-churn
 Churn modelling of bank customers using supervised machine learning (classification)
 
 # project description
The problem I worked on,is in the context of customer loyalty. 
In fact, the client here is a multinational bank operating across Europe. 
They have solid customers network in three European countries, France, Germany and Spain. T
he client now wants to analyse the impact of several factors on loyalty of the customers and ultimately be able to predict this based on those factors. 
This business case can be efficiently modelled using Machine Learning. 
Now, the target for the bank is to be able to predict customer loyalty. 
This can be seen in its simplest form as whether a customer will leave the bank in a certain period. 
Multiple factors have been identified by the bank as potential impactful factors on this variable. 
Such factors are usually identified based on expert knowledge and some can even be based on business hunch. 
However, a step in the analysis would be to see how important such factors are and whether they should be used to predict the target variable. 
 
 # data
 There are 10000 rows in dataset with total 12 columns. 
 The “Tenure” column shows how long the customers have been with the bank. 
 The “Balance” column shows the balance of customer at that point in time, 
 the “NumOfProducts” column represent how many products they have, like saving account or credit card, loan etc. 
 “HasCrCard” column is a flag to show weather the customer has credit card or not.
 “IsActiveMember” column is another yes or No flag to show if a customer is an active member or not for example whether the customer logged into their online banking or whether they did a transaction in last 2 months. T
 he names of rest of the columns are self-explanatory. 
 The last column will tell us whether the customer left the bank within those 6 months.1== Exited, 0 == Not Exited.
